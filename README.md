### Description
Smart Wardrobe allows you to track the clothing items you own. You may enter the temperature of the day and receive an appropriate outfit recommendation. This will greatly reduce the amount of time users spend looking through their wardrobes for what to wear.

Backend:
- [x] We have two models: Item and Style and they have a one-to-many relationship.
- [x] We have 5 routes, including a GET route for getting the entire wardrobe, POST routes for creating an item, and a DELETE route for deleting an item 
- [x] There is API specification in our ```app.py```
